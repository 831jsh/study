Overview
========

- heapster는 resource usage metrics를 계산하기 위해 cAdvisor를 사용해 container cluster 모니터링을 가능하게 함
- kube 와 coreos 지원 (확대할 예정)

Running Heapster on Kubernetes
==============================

- pluggable storage backend 지원 (influxdb with Grafana, Google Cloud Monitoring, Google Cloud Logging)
